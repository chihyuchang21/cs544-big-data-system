# Intro to Big Data System
This repository contains my learning outcomes and project work from **CS544: Intro to Big Data Systems** at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

## Course Overview
CS544 is a systems-focused course designed to introduce students to large-scale data processing systems. The course covers practical deployment techniques and dives deep into distributed data systems like Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra, and Kafka.
The course is organized into three major parts:

### Part 1: Resources
- **Deployment Basics**
  - Linux Shell & Pipelines
  - Docker and Docker Compose
- **Networking**
  - Web Servers and gRPC
- **Memory & Compute**
  - Caching, PyArrow, Multithreading, Locks
- **Storage Systems**
  - Filesystems, Data Formats
- **SQL Databases**
  - MySQL, ACID, Transactions

### Part 2: Clusters
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**
- **MapReduce Concepts**
- **Spark Ecosystem**
  - RDDs, DataFrames, Spark SQL, Internals
  - Machine Learning with Spark MLlib

### Part 3: Cloud and Streaming
- **Cassandra**
  - Data Modeling, Partitioning, Replication
- **Kafka**
  - Stream Processing, Reliability
- **BigQuery**
  - Cloud-native Analytics and ML Integration

## Projects

Throughout the semester, the following projects were completed:
- **P1:** Dockerized deployment
- **P2:** Network and memory resource experiments
- **P3:** Compute + Storage resource interaction
- **P4–P6:** Cluster-based analysis using Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra
- **P7–P8:** Real-time streaming & cloud analytics using Kafka and BigQuery
